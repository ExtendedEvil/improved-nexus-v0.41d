- Fixed(?) DBFG marines dealing tonnes of dmg (DamageType was "Players")
- Not Fixed Hackroid weapons working with no ammo (it became a feature)
- Fixed Leg behemoth cannon spawn sprite
- Removed PIERCEARMOR from every monster using it (I hope)
- ^Same with FOILINVUL
- Fixed (hopefully once and for all) the wrong invbar sprites of Gaturra's beacons
