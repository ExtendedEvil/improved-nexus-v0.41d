---V1.94:---


- Many weapons/monsters/items have their code changed, if you replaced anything make sure to check all of them for compatibility reasons.
This also requires updating KEYCONFIG and SBARINFO.
- All weapons have their Select/Deselect states changed, make sure to replace accordingly to apply the faster weapon switching.
- Original nemesis and enraged monster actors don't have remove states, but they're replaced with one in RemoveStateOverride.txt (an easy method if switching to ACS spawners)
However, NoRemoveStates.txt have monsters with no remove states for guaranteed spawns.
- All HPBAR monster tagging must be done with LANGUAGE (or intern actor tags), CVARINFO does not work, see the LANGUAGE file to gain insight.
