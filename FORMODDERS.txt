A few rules for modders, including those people that want to make addons for Improved Nexus

0) DO NOT USE 123666789 as HUDMESSAGE id, because it will conflict with the Skulltag runes messages

1) Don't setup the weapon slots in KEYCONF. SETSLOT is extremely outdated and overrides any other slot setting
method. This is clearly written here: https://zdoom.org/wiki/Adding_weaponsections (Zdoom 2.3.0 is Stone Age).
It was so annoying in old mods that GZdoom developers had to create an option to prevent KEYCONF loading all the
SETSLOT shit.
Use Weapon.SlotPriority and Weapon.SlotNumber that are compatible with every other mod out there.

2) If your scripts need a lot of conditions, DO NOT abuse "else if(s)". LANGUAGE strings and arrays are way way
way way way way way better and avoid recursive checks every time you need them.

3) Unless you REALLY need it (likely never), don't abuse replacement. An addon can be made without reaching 
the nth replacement of every single fucking actor. LegendaryZombie5 doesn't help anyone and, as you can see,
 is not needed.

4) Before replacing a system or a script that you don't understand how to work with, try to ask to who made it. 
There's a decent chance you will get tips and hints and have enough help to work with it.

5) Stop using numbered scripts and use only named scripts, possibly with hard-to-clone names. Numbered scripts
are used in UMDF maps: using scripts with the same numbers would replace them and the maps would break.

6) Learn how to use "####" as sprite and "#" as frame. It's helpful with repetitive actors (see XXXPresentActive)

7) 
ACTOR VoidCore : NemesisSphere
{
....
States
{
.....
	Pickup:
	  TNT1 A 0
	  TNT1 A 0 A_JumpIfInventory("VoidCoreItem",1,"Nope")
	  TNT1 A 0 A_StopSound(7)
	  TNT1 A 1 A_GiveInventory("VoidCoreItem")
	  Stop
	Nope:
	  TNT1 A 1
	  Fail
	 }
}

ACTOR VoidCoreItem : CustomInventory
{
....
States
	  {
      Use:
	    TNT1 A 1 A_SpawnItemEx("VoidCoreActive",0,0,16,8,0,4,0)
	    Stop
      }
}

^ This is completely useless.
- Nope state doesn't need to exist, because for Inventory you can simply jump to "Null" if you only want it to fail.
- These two items can be combined into 1. Inventory.MaxAmount 1 will prevent a second pickup

8) DECORATE can use frandom for fixed numbers. 0.01*Random(100,200) is equal to frandom(1.0,2.0)
